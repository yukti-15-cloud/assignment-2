        <h1>DRY ERASE:</h1>

        <h2>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A glass plate, bowl, or picture frame.</li>
            <li>Dry erase marker</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Draw a simple picture on the glass. A stick figure is good one to start with.</li>
            <li>Pour water onto the plate or into the bowl slowly to lift up the drawing.</li>
            <li>Swirl the water around to make the picture dance and move.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>HOW IT WORKS:</h2>
        <p>The marker leaves behind a mixture of pigments and a type of alcohol mixed together. The alcohol dissolves and the pigments are left behind as a solid. Glass is so smooth that it slides right off when it gets wet!</p>
