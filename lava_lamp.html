    <h1>Lava Lamp</h1>
    
    <h2>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A clean plastic bottle, try to use one with smooth sides</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil or mineral baby oil</li>
        <li>Fizzing tablets (like Alka Seltzer)</li>
        <li>Food Coloring</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill up the bottle about 1/4th with water.</li>
        <li>Pour the vegetable oil in the bottle until it’s almost full; you may have to wait for a few minutes for the oil and water to separate.</li>
        <li>Add a few drops of your favourite food color. Watch as the color sinks through the oil. Did your drops of color mix with the water immediately or float in between for a few minutes?</li>
        <li>Break your fizzy tablet in half and drop part of it into the bottle. Get ready…here comes the bubble blobs!</li>
        <li>You can even get a flashlight, turn off the lights and drop in another half tablet.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>HOW IT WORKS:</h2>
    <p>The oil floats on the top of the water because it is less dense or lighter than water. The food coloring has the same density as the water so it sinks through the oil and mixes with the water. When you add the tablet, it sinks to the bottom and starts to dissolve. As it dissolves, it makes gas, carbon dioxide. Gas or air is lighter than water so it floats to the top. The air bubbles bring some colored water with them to the top. When the air comes out of the coloured water blob, the water gets heavy again and sinks. It does this over and over until the tablet is completely dissolved.</p>
