        <h2>MATERIALS REQUIRED :</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>one balloon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS :</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Blow up the balloon so that it is filled with air.</li>
            <li>Hold the balloon up to your ear.</li>
            <li>Lightly tap the other side of the balloon with your finger. Can you hear the sound well? Can you hear the vibrations?</li>
            <li>Now let the balloon go!!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>HOW IT WORKS :</h2>
        <p>When you blow into the balloon you are pushing air molecules in the balloon. They are forced into a close area so that they are very close. These circumstances allow the air molecules to carry the sound waves better.</p>
