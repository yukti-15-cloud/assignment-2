        <h1>MAKING A VOLCANO:</h1>
        <h2>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 ml of dish soap.</li>
            <li>100 ml of warm water.</li>
            <li>400 ml of white vinegar.</li>
            <li>Food Colouring.</li>
            <li>Baking soda (fill up about half with baking soda, then fill the rest of the way with water).</li>
            <li>Empty 2-litre soda bottle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This should be done outside to avoid mess.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the vinegar water, dish soap, and 2 drops of food colouring into the empty soda bottle.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon to mix the baking soda slurry until it is all a liquid.</li>
            <li>Erup{tion time!} ... pour the baking soda slurry into the soda bottle quickly and step back.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>HOW IT WORKS:</h2>
        <p>A chemical reaction between vinegar and baking soda creates a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the same type of gas used to make the carbonation in sodas. What happens if you shake up a soda? The gas gets very excited and tries to spread out. There is not enough room in the bottle for the gas to spread out, so it leaves through the opening very quickly, causing an eruption!</p>
