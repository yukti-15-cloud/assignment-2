        <h2>How It Works:</h2>
        <p>When acids and bases mix, you get some exciting chemistry. Orange and other citrus fruits are filled with citric acid. It is safe acid, and it's what gives oranges, lemons, and limes their sourness. Baking soda is a base, the opposite of an acid. It's also safe, but doesn't taste very good on its own, and will give you a tummy ache if you eat a lot of it. As the citric acid and baking soda mix, it makes millions of carbon dioxide bubbles, the same gas you breathe out, and the same one that makes soda fizzy.</p>
